Facebook's React Tutorial With Gulp

This repo follows Facebook's React tutorial and uses Gulp with an express server.

It also uses browserify and reactify to enable modular components and JSX => JS conversion.

To run the server, navigate to the project director on the command line and type `gulp`.

This will start a server listening on posrt 3000 of localhost.

This repo also uses gulp-livereload to watch for any changes made on the file system. 

The Chrome LiveReload extension must be installed for this to take effect.
